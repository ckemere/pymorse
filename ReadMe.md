hi this is our ELEC 483 final project 
<br/>We wrote a python script of Morse wavelet transform based on Jonathan Lilly's Matlab implementation of Morse Wavelet https://github.com/jonathanlilly/jLab/tree/master/jWavelet

### files ###
* 'morsefuncs.py'
  * includes helper functions to generate the generalized morse wavelets
* 'morsewave.py'
  * generates the first/primary family of morse wavelets
* 'transform.py'
  * morse wavelet transform
#### dependencies ####
&nbsp;&nbsp; scipy v1.1.0, numpy v1.15
#### note from the authors ####
&nbsp;&nbsp; this code only works for the first/primary family of morse wavelets. the code for the secondary family of morse wavelets is &nbsp;&nbsp; still in "experimental" mode, according to Jonathan Lilly's Matlab implementation.

&nbsp;&nbsp; please read the comments of each function for other small notes, such as a change of parameters from the Matlab code.
